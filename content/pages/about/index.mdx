I am a <Year birthDate="1995-05-13" /> years old software engineer from Lithuania.

Currently I am located in Oslo, Norway and working at DNB which is Norways largest bank.

I've been passionate about technology and programming since I was 12 years old, since then I’ve seen many projects being developed successfully or failing in doing so. I learned from the mistakes others and myself have made, because only that and practice can make you become better at something.

I’ve always had a big interest in technologies thus I’m constantly keeping myself up-to-date and experiment with the newest web technologies and development standards. I always want to stay one step ahead. By focusing on the future we can realize bigger opportunities.

On my free time I try to build great things!
